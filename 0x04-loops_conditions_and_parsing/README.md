# Bash Scripting Tasks

This repository contains Bash scripts that demonstrate various concepts and practices in Bash scripting. Each script is designed to fulfill specific requirements outlined in the tasks.

## Task 0: Create a SSH RSA key pair

In this task, we generate an RSA key pair and share the public key. The public key is added to the SSH public key field of the intranet profile.

## Task 1: For Loop in Bash

This task demonstrates the usage of a `for` loop in Bash. We use a `for` loop to display the phrase "Best School" 10 times.

## Task 2: While Loop in Bash

This task showcases the usage of a `while` loop in Bash. We utilize a `while` loop to display the phrase "Best School" 10 times, with a special condition to print "Hi" on the 9th iteration.

## Task 3: If Statement in Bash

Here, we employ the `if` statement in Bash. The script loops through numbers from 1 to 10 and displays different messages based on the loop iteration.

## Task 4: Case Statement in Bash

This task utilizes the `case` statement in Bash. The script displays numbers from 1 to 20 and provides custom messages for specific loop iterations.

## Task 5: Looping Time Display

In this task, we display time in hours and minutes using a `while` loop. The script shows hours from 0 to 12 and minutes from 1 to 59.

## Task 6: List Contents Display

This script displays the contents of the current directory in a list format. Only the part of the name after the first dash is displayed, and hidden files are excluded.

## Task 7: File Information Check

Here, we check information about a file using `if` and `else` statements. The script checks if the file exists, if it's empty, and if it's a regular file.

## Task 8: File Information Check (Alternative)

Similar to Task 7, this script checks file information using `if` and `else` statements. However, it uses different conditions and logic to achieve the same outcome.

## Task 9: File Existence and Status Check

This task checks file existence and status using `if` and `else` statements. The script verifies if the file exists, if it's empty, and if it's a regular file.

## Task 10: FizzBuzz Challenge

In this task, we solve the classic FizzBuzz problem using Bash scripting. The script displays numbers from 1 to 100 and prints "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both 3 and 5.
