## Regular Expressions Project

This project focuses on mastering regular expressions using the Oniguruma library in Ruby. You'll be creating Ruby scripts that utilize regular expressions to match specific patterns within text.

### Project Overview

The project tasks involve building regular expressions to match various patterns as specified in the instructions. Each task requires creating a Ruby script that accepts input and applies the regular expression to match the pattern. Below are the tasks included in this project:

1. **Simply matching School**: Create a regular expression that matches the string "School". Implement a Ruby script that accepts one argument and passes it to a regular expression matching method.

2. **Repetition Token #0**: Find the regular expression that matches specific cases. Create a Ruby script that accepts one argument and uses a regular expression to match the pattern.

3. **Repetition Token #1**: Similar to Task 2, find the regular expression for another set of cases and create a Ruby script accordingly.

4. **Repetition Token #2**: Repeat the process for a different set of cases.

5. **Repetition Token #3**: Find the regular expression for specified cases without using square brackets. Implement a Ruby script as before.

6. **Not quite HBTN yet**: Create a regular expression that matches strings starting with "h", ending with "n", and having any single character in between. Develop a corresponding Ruby script.

7. **Call me maybe**: Construct a regular expression to match a 10-digit phone number. Write a Ruby script to apply the regex to input strings.

8. **OMG WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING?**: Build a regular expression to match capital letters only. Develop a Ruby script that utilizes this regex.

9. **Textme (Advanced)**: This task involves processing log entries related to text messages. You need to extract specific information (sender, receiver, and flags) from the log entries using regular expressions. Implement a Ruby script to accomplish this task.

### Repository Structure

- **Directory**: `0x06-regular_expressions`
- **Files**:
  - `0-simply_match_school.rb`
  - `1-repetition_token_0.rb`
  - `2-repetition_token_1.rb`
  - `3-repetition_token_2.rb`
  - `4-repetition_token_3.rb`
  - `5-beginning_and_end.rb`
  - `6-phone_number.rb`
  - `7-OMG_WHY_ARE_YOU_SHOUTING.rb`

### Instructions

- Ensure all your files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- All files should end with a new line.
- Make sure your scripts are executable (`chmod +x <filename>`).
- The first line of your Ruby scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env ruby`.
- Your regular expressions must be built for the Oniguruma library.
- A `README.md` file must be present at the root of the project folder, providing an overview of the project, tasks, repository structure, and instructions.
