# Automated Screenshot Upload for Command Line Game

## Overview
This project automates the process of playing a command line game and capturing screenshots every 9 levels passed, totaling 27 levels. The captured screenshots are then uploaded to a server using an SFTP command-line tool. Finally, the screenshots are committed to a GitHub repository under the name of 'alx-system_engineering-devops'.

## Prerequisites
- Command line game installed and configured.
- SFTP command-line tool installed and configured.
- Git installed and configured.
- Access to a server for uploading screenshots via SFTP.
- Access to a GitHub repository with permissions to commit.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alx-system_engineering-devops/screenshot-upload.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd screenshot-upload
   ```
3. Install any necessary dependencies.

## Usage
1. Start the command line game.
2. Play the game and progress through levels.
3. Once every 9 levels are passed, a screenshot will be automatically captured.
4. Screenshots will be stored in the 'screenshots' directory.
5. Run the SFTP command-line tool to upload the screenshots to the server:
   ```bash
   sftp username@servername
   ```
   Enter your password when prompted.
6. Navigate to the directory where screenshots should be uploaded:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/upload/directory
   ```
7. Use the `put` command to upload screenshots:
   ```bash
   put /path/to/local/screenshots/*.png
   ```
8. Exit the SFTP session:
   ```bash
   exit
   ```
9. Commit the screenshots to the GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add screenshots for levels passed"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Notes
- Ensure that the server and GitHub repository configurations are correctly set up.
- Adjust the level count and upload frequency as necessary in the script.
- This README assumes basic familiarity with command line tools and Git.
- For any issues or improvements, please raise a GitHub issue or pull request.
