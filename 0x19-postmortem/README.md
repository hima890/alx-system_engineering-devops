**Issue Summary: The Great Memory Leak of 2024**

- **Duration:** 2 hours and 15 minutes of "fun," from 14:30 UTC to 16:45 UTC. We spent this time getting to know our load balancer’s memory leaks a little too well.
- **Impact:** Imagine 80% of our users eagerly trying to log in, browse products, or make purchases, only to be met with spinning wheels and timeouts. It was like watching a pot boil—if the pot was our servers and the boiling was... well, nothing happening at all. E-commerce transactions? Frozen. User experience? Throttled. Our engineering team’s anxiety? Sky-high.
- **Root Cause:** The root cause was a misconfigured HAProxy load balancer that became as bloated as a post-holiday meal. Thanks to a memory leak, it eventually crashed under the weight of its own indulgence.

**Timeline:**

- **14:30 UTC:** Our monitoring system, Datadog, suddenly went from “all good” to “Houston, we have a problem,” reporting a spike in failed logins and customer complaints flooding in like a burst dam.
- **14:35 UTC:** The engineering team sprinted to their keyboards, suspecting the authentication microservice might be throwing a tantrum.
- **14:45 UTC:** After poking around, the team realized it wasn’t the authentication service. They passed the buck—uh, escalated the issue—to the network operations team.
- **15:00 UTC:** The network team took the bait and started investigating the MySQL database, which, to be fair, *was* acting a bit sluggish. False alarm.
- **15:20 UTC:** Someone finally got a bright idea—what if the problem was with HAProxy, our good old load balancer? (Better late than never, right?)
- **15:40 UTC:** They noticed that HAProxy had gone on a memory binge and was paying the price. Time to hit the emergency stop.
- **15:50 UTC:** The memory leak was traced back to a recent update. Who knew a few lines of code could cause such chaos?
- **16:10 UTC:** The fix was simple: roll back the update. Boom—HAProxy was back to being lean and mean.
- **16:30 UTC:** Services started coming back online. Users could finally log in without needing a prayer.
- **16:45 UTC:** Full recovery. High fives all around (virtually, of course).

**Root Cause and Resolution: How We Fixed HAProxy’s Hunger**

The culprit behind this chaotic episode was a memory leak in HAProxy caused by a recent misconfiguration. Specifically, a timeout setting that was as strict as an all-you-can-eat buffet with no plate limit, allowing too many stale connections to pile up. HAProxy tried to keep up, but eventually, it was just too much. We rolled back to the previous version, which didn’t have these issues, and instantly saw the memory usage drop back to normal. 

**Corrective and Preventative Measures: How to Keep HAProxy in Check**

- **Stop the Insanity!** Before deploying any configuration updates, especially for something as critical as HAProxy, we’ll test it thoroughly in a staging environment. No more “live and learn” on production.
  
- **Monitor Like It’s 1999:** We’ll add more detailed monitoring for HAProxy’s memory usage and connection handling. If it starts gobbling up memory again, we’ll know before it hits critical mass.
  
- **Rollback? Make It Snappy!** Automate rollback procedures so that if something does go wrong, we can hit the undo button faster than you can say “load balancer.”

- **Training Montage:** (Cue the 80s music.) We’ll get our teams cross-trained on spotting these kinds of issues, so they can jump to the right conclusion—like a cat on a laser pointer—next time.

- **Postmortem Party:** Regular postmortem reviews will be scheduled to discuss any future hiccups and brainstorm how to avoid them, complete with donuts and coffee (or at least some good GIFs).

**TODO:**

- Patch the current HAProxy configuration and lock it down like Fort Knox.
- Enhance monitoring with extra metrics, alerts, and maybe a bit of AI to catch anything funky before it becomes a problem.
- Automate the rollback process in our CI/CD pipeline, ensuring that we’re ready to roll back faster than a bad haircut.
- Roll out training programs and maybe a cool badge for anyone who spots a memory leak first.
