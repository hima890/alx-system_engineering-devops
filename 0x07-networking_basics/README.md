## Networking Basics

This repository contains Bash scripts covering various networking concepts and tasks on Ubuntu servers. Each script is designed to perform specific networking-related functions. Below are the tasks covered along with their descriptions and usage examples:

### Task 0: OSI Model

**Description:**
This task introduces the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, which is an abstract model to describe layered communication and computer network design. The script focuses on the Transport layer (TCP/UDP) and the Network layer (IP and ICMP) of the OSI model.

### Task 1: Types of Network

**Description:**
This task covers different types of networks such as LAN, WAN, and the Internet. It explores how these networks connect devices and facilitate communication.

### Task 2: MAC and IP Address

**Description:**
This task focuses on MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses. It explains their roles and importance in network communication.

**Repo:**

- Directory: 0x07-networking_basics
- File: 2-MAC_and_IP_address

### Task 3: UDP and TCP

**Description:**
This task explores UDP (hima890 Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which are protocols used for data transmission over networks. It discusses their characteristics and use cases.

**Repo:**
- GitHub Repository: [alx-system_engineering-devops](https://github.com/hima890/alx-system_engineering-devops)
- Directory: 0x07-networking_basics
- File: 3-UDP_and_TCP

### Task 4: TCP and UDP Ports

**Description:**
This task focuses on TCP and UDP ports, which are essential for directing network traffic to specific applications or services. It provides a Bash script that displays listening ports, including the PID and program name associated with each socket.

**Repo:**
- GitHub Repository: [alx-system_engineering-devops](https://github.com/hima890/alx-system_engineering-devops)
- Directory: 0x07-networking_basics
- File: 4-TCP_and_UDP_ports

### Task 5: Is the Host on the Network

**Description:**
This task involves writing a Bash script that uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to ping an IP address passed as an argument. It checks if the specified host is reachable on the network.

**Repo:**
- GitHub Repository: [alx-system_engineering-devops](https://github.com/hima890/alx-system_engineering-devops)
- Directory: 0x07-networking_basics
- File: 5-is_the_host_on_the_network

**Note:** Each script includes comments explaining its purpose and functionality. Additionally, ensure to follow the provided instructions and usage examples for optimal results.
